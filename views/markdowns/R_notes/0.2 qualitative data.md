### Qualitative data      
A data sample is called _qualitative_, also known as _categorical_, if its values belong to a collection of known defined non-overlapping classes. Common examples include student letter grade (A, B, C, D or F), commercial bond rating (AAA, AAB, ...) and consumer clothing shoe sizes (1, 2, 3, ...).

#### frequency distribution of qualitative data   
The frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the data occurrence in a collection of non-overlapping categories.The `table()` function simply needs an object that can be interpreted as a categorical variable (called a “factor” in R).
```r
> library(MASS)                 # load the MASS package
> school = painters$School      # the painter schools
> school.freq = table(school)   # apply the table functions
> school.freq
school
 A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H
10  6  6 10  7  4  7  4

> cbind(school.freq)    # use cbind to print result in column format
  school.freq
A          10
B           6
C           6
D          10
E           7
F           4
G           7
H           4
```

    data.frame(patient = 1:100,
               age = rnorm(100, mean = 60, sd = 6),
               treatment = gl(2, 50,
                 labels = c("Treatment", "Control")),
               center = sample(paste("Center", LETTERS[1:5]), 100, replace = TRUE))

#### relative distribution of qualitative data    
The relative frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the frequency proportion in a collection of non-overlapping categories.

__Relative frequencey = (frequency)/(sample size)__

+ Find the relative frequency distribution of the painter schools in the data set painters.

```r
> library(MASS)                 # load the MASS package
> school = painters$School      # the painter schools
> school.freq = table(school)   # apply the table function

> school.relfreq = school.freq / nrow(painters)   # sample size = nrow(painters)
                                                  #           not nrow(painters$School)

> school.relfreq

       G        H
0.129630 0.074074

## an enhanced solution
> old = options(digits=1)        # print few digit using digit options
> cbind(school.relfreq)          # print result in volumn format
  school.relfreq

H           0.07
> options(old)                   # restore the old option
```


#### bar graph    
A bar graph of a qualitative data sample consists of vertical parallel bars that shows the frequency distribution graphically.

+ Find the bar graph of the painter schools in the data set painters.

```r
> library(MASS)                 # load the MASS package
> school = painters$School      # the painter schools
> school.freq = table(school)   # apply the table function

> barplot(school.freq)         # apply the barplot function

## an enhanced answer
> colors = c("red", "yellow", "green", "violet",      # select a color palette
+   "orange", "blue", "pink", "cyan")
> barplot(school.freq,         # apply the barplot function
+   col=colors)                # set the color palette
```


#### pie chart    
A pie chart of a qualitative data sample consists of pizza wedges that shows the frequency distribution graphically.

+ Find the pie chart of the painter schools in the data set painters.

```r
> library(MASS)                 # load the MASS package
> school = painters$School      # the painter schools
> school.freq = table(school)   # apply the table function

> pie(school.freq)              # apply the pie function
```

#### category statistics     
Suppose we would like to know which school has the highest mean composition score. We would have to first find out the mean composition score of each school. The following shows how to find the mean composition score of an arbitrarily chosen school.

+ Find out the mean composition score of school C in the data set painters.

```r
> library(MASS)                 # load the MASS package
> school = painters$School      # the painter schools
> c_school = school == "C"      # the logical index vector for school C

> c_painters = painters[c_school, ]  # find child data set of painters for school C

> mean(c_painters$Composition)       # find mean composition score of school C
[1] 13.167

> tapply(painters$Composition, painters$School, mean)     # tapply function compute all means of each category  
     A      B      C      D      E      F      G      H
10.400 12.167 13.167  9.100 13.571  7.250 13.857 14.000
```

+ `tapply`    
For datasets that can be broken down into groups (categorical), and apply a function in each group

`tapply(Summary Variable, Group Variable, Function)`

```r
> ## Medical Example
> tapply(medical.example$age, medical.example$treatment, mean)
Treatment   Control
 62.26883  60.30371
> ## Baseball Example
> tapply(baseball.example$batting.average, baseball.example$team,
         max)
   Team A    Team B    Team C    Team D    Team E
0.3784396 0.3012680 0.3488655 0.2962828 0.3858841
