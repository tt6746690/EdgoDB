### quantitative data   
Quantitative data, also known as _continuous data_, consists of numeric data that support arithmetic operations. This is in contrast with qualitative data, whose values belong to pre-defined classes with no arithmetic operation allowed.

```r
> head(faithful)
  eruptions waiting
1     3.600      79
2     1.800      54
3     3.333      74
4     2.283      62
5     4.533      85
6     2.883      550
```


#### frequency distribution of quatitative data
The frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the data occurrence in a collection of non-overlapping categories.

+ In the data set faithful, the frequency distribution of the eruptions variable is the summary of eruptions according to some classification of the eruption durations.


+ `seq` generate regular sequences   
default:

```r
## Default S3 method:
seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),
    length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)
```

+ `cut` breaks up a continuous variable such as age into a categorical variable. Divides the range of x into intervals and codes the values in x according to which interval they fall. The leftmost interval corresponds to level one, the next leftmost to level two and so on.

+ x	- a numeric vector which is to be converted to a factor by cutting.     
+ breaks - either a numeric vector of two or more unique cut points or a single number (greater than or equal to 2) giving the number of intervals into which x is to be cut.    
+ labels - labels for the levels of the resulting category. By default, labels are constructed using "(a,b]" interval notation. If labels = FALSE, simple integer codes are returned instead of a factor.   
+ include.lowest - logical, indicating if an ‘x[i]’ equal to the lowest (or highest, for right = FALSE) ‘breaks’ value should be included.
+ right - logical, indicating if the intervals should be closed on the right (and open on the left) or vice versa.

```r
cut(x, ...)      
# default
cut(x, breaks, labels = NULL,
    include.lowest = FALSE, right = TRUE, dig.lab = 3,
    ordered_result = FALSE, ...)
```

```r
## 1. find range of eruption duration
> duration = faithful$eruptions
> range(duration)
[1] 1.6 5.1

## 2. Break the range into non-overlapping sub-intervals by defining a sequence of equal distance break points.
> breaks = seq(1.5, 5.5, by=0.5)    # set breakpoints to a half-integer sequence
> breaks
[1] 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5

## 3. Classify the eruption durations according to the half-unit-length sub-intervals with cut.
> duration.cut = cut(duration, breaks, right=FALSE)
> duration.cut
 [1] [3.5,4) [1.5,2) [3,3.5) [2,2.5) [4.5,5) [2.5,3) [4.5,5) [3.5,4) [1.5,2)
[10] [4,4.5) [1.5,2) [3.5,4) [4,4.5) [1.5,2) [4.5,5) [2,2.5) [1.5,2) [4.5,5)
[19] [1.5,2) [4,4.5) [1.5,2) [1.5,2) [3,3.5) [3,3.5) [4.5,5) [3.5,4) [1.5,2)
......

## 4. Compute the frequency of eruptions in each sub-interval with the table function.
> duration.freq = table(duration.cut)
> duration.freq         ## frequency distribution of eruption duration
[1.5,2) [2,2.5) [2.5,3) [3,3.5) [3.5,4) [4,4.5) [4.5,5)
     51      41       5       7      30      73      61
[5,5.5)
      4

## cbind to result in column presentation
> cbind(duration.freq)
        duration.freq
[1.5,2)            51
[2,2.5)            41
[2.5,3)             5
[3,3.5)             7
[3.5,4)            30
[4,4.5)            73
[4.5,5)            61
[5,5.5)             4
```


### Histogram    
A histogram consists of parallel vertical bars that graphically shows the frequency distribution of a quantitative variable. The area of each bar is equal to the frequency of items found in each class.

+ In the data set faithful, the histogram of the eruptions variable is a collection of parallel vertical bars showing the number of eruptions classified according to their durations.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions
> hist(duration,    # apply the hist function
+   right=FALSE)    # intervals closed on the left

## The histogram of the data is the same as barplot of relative frequency of eruptions,
## other than the latter have predefined bins
```


### Relative frequency distribution of quantitative data    
The relative frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the frequency proportion in a collection of non-overlapping categories.

+ __relative frequency = (frequency)/(sample size)__   

+ In the data set faithful, the relative frequency distribution of the eruptions variable shows the frequency proportion of the eruptions according to a duration classification.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions
> breaks = seq(1.5, 5.5, by=0.5)
> duration.cut = cut(duration, breaks, right=FALSE)
> duration.freq = table(duration.cut)

> duration.relfreq = duration.freq / nrow(faithful)

> cbind(duration.freq, duration.relfreq)
        duration.freq duration.relfreq

[5,5.5)             4             0.01
```

### Cumulative frequency distribution
The cumulative frequency distribution of a quantitative variable is a summary of data frequency below a given level.

+ In the data set faithful, the cumulative frequency distribution of the eruptions variable shows the total number of eruptions whose durations are less than or equal to a set of chosen levels.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions
> breaks = seq(1.5, 5.5, by=0.5)

### Cumulative frequency graph    
A cumulative frequency graph or ogive of a quantitative variable is a curve graphically showing the cumulative frequency distribution.

+ In the data set faithful, a point in the cumulative frequency graph of the eruptions variable shows the total number of eruptions whose durations are less than or equal to a given level.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions

> duration.freq = table(duration.cut)

> cumfreq0 = c(0, cumsum(duration.freq))
> plot(breaks, cumfreq0,            # plot the data
+   main="Old Faithful Eruptions",  # main title
+   xlab="Duration minutes",        # x−axis label
+   ylab="Cumulative eruptions")   # y−axis label
> lines(breaks, cumfreq0)           # join the points

```

+ `line`  
A generic function taking coordinates given in various ways and joining the corresponding points with line segments.   
+ x,y - coordinates of the points to join   

```r
lines(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:
lines(x, y = NULL, type = "l", ...)
```

### Cumulative relative frequency distribution   
The cumulative relative frequency distribution of a quantitative variable is a summary of frequency proportion below a given level.

+ __cumulative relative frequency = (cumulative frequency)/(sample size)__

+ In the data set faithful, the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the eruptions variable shows the frequency proportion of eruptions whose durations are less than or equal to a set of chosen levels.

#### Cumulative relative frequency graph
A cumulative relative frequency graph of a quantitative variable is a curve graphically showing the cumulative relative frequency distribution.

+ In the data set faithful, a point in the cumulative relative frequency graph of the eruptions variable shows the frequency proportion of eruptions whose durations are less than or equal to a given level.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions
> breaks = seq(1.5, 5.5, by=0.5)
> duration.cut = cut(duration, breaks, right=FALSE)
> duration.freq = table(duration.cut)
> duration.cumfreq = cumsum(duration.freq)
> duration.cumrelfreq = duration.cumfreq / nrow(faithful)

> cumrelfreq0 = c(0, duration.cumrelfreq)       # assign a zero value
> plot(breaks, cumrelfreq0,
+   main="Old Faithful Eruptions",  # main title
+   xlab="Duration minutes",
+   ylab="Cumulative eruption proportion")
> lines(breaks, cumrelfreq0)        # join the points

## alternatively We create an interpolate function Fn with the built-in function ecdf.
## Then we plot Fn right away. There is no need to compute the cumulative frequency distribution a priori.
> Fn = ecdf(duration)
> plot(Fn,
+   main="Old Faithful Eruptions",
+   xlab="Duration minutes",
+   ylab="Cumulative eruption proportion")
```

+ `ecdf`
Compute an empirical cumulative distribution function, with several methods for plotting, printing and computing with such an “ecdf” object.  
+ `x, object` - numeric vector of the observation for ecdf

```r
ecdf(x)

## S3 method for class 'ecdf'
plot(x, ..., ylab="Fn(x)", verticals = FALSE,
     col.01line = "gray70", pch = 19)

x <- rnorm(12)
Fn <- ecdf(x)
Fn     # a *function*
Fn(x)  # returns the percentiles for x
tt <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1)
12 * Fn(tt) # Fn is a 'simple' function {with values k/12}
summary(Fn)
##--> see below for graphics
knots(Fn)  # the unique data values {12 of them if there were no ties}

y <- round(rnorm(12), 1); y[3] <- y[1]
Fn12 <- ecdf(y)
Fn12
knots(Fn12) # unique values (always less than 12!)
summary(Fn12)
summary.stepfun(Fn12)
```


### Scatterplot  
A scatter plot pairs up values of two quantitative variables in a data set and display them as geometric points inside a Cartesian diagram.

+ n the data set faithful, we pair up the eruptions and waiting values in the same observation as (x,y) coordinates. Then we plot the points in the Cartesian plane. Here is a preview of the eruption data value pairs with the help of the cbind function.

```r
> duration = faithful$eruptions      # the eruption durations - numeric
> waiting = faithful$waiting         # the waiting interval   - numeric
> head(cbind(duration, waiting))     # cbind creates a        - matrix
     duration waiting
[1,]    3.600      79
[2,]    1.800      54
[3,]    3.333      74
[4,]    2.283      62
[5,]    4.533      85
[6,]    2.883      55

> plot(duration, waiting,            # plot the variables
+   xlab="Eruption duration",        # x−axis label
+   ylab="Time waited")              # y−axis label

> abline(lm(waiting ~ duration))     # lm() generate regression, abline() draw the line
                                     # lm(response ~ predictor)
```

+ `abline`  
This function adds one or more straight lines through the current plot.    
+ `a,b` - the intercept and the slope
+ `untf` - logical asking whether to _untransform_   
+ `h` - the y-value(s) for horizontal line(s).  
+ `v` - the x-value(s) for vertical line(s).

```r
abline(a = NULL, b = NULL, h = NULL, v = NULL, reg = NULL,
       coef = NULL, untf = FALSE, ...)

```

+ `lm`  
lm is used to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance

```r
lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action,
   method = "qr", model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE,
   singular.ok = TRUE, contrasts = NULL, offset, ...)
```
