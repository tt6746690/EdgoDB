### BASIC DATA TYPES

#### NUMERIC
+ default computational data type, representing decimals  

```r
> x = 10.5       # assign a decimal value
> x              # print the value of x
[1] 10.5
> class(x)       # print the class name of x
[1] "numeric"
> k = 1          # assigning integer to k, k still stored as numeric
> k              # print the value of k
[1] 1
> class(k)       # print the class name of k
[1] "numeric"
```

#### integers
+ `as.integer` function used to assign integers

```r
> y = as.integer(3)
> y              # print the value of y
[1] 3
> class(y)       # print the class name of y
[1] "integer"
> is.integer(y)  # is y an integer?
[1] TRUE
```

+ coersion of numeric to integers
```r
> as.integer(3.14)    # coerce a numeric value
[1] 3
```

+ __TRUE__ has value of 1 and __FALSE__ has value of 0
```r
> as.integer(TRUE)    # the numeric value of TRUE
[1] 1
> as.integer(FALSE)   # the numeric value of FALSE
[1] 0
```

#### complex
+ defined via pure imaginary values `i`
```r
> z = 1 + 2i     # create a complex number
> z              # print the value of z
[1] 1+2i
> class(z)       # print the class name of z
[1] "complex"
```

#### logical
+ often created when comparing variables
```r
> x = 1; y = 2   # sample values
> z = x > y      # is x larger than y?
> z              # print the logical value
[1] FALSE
> class(z)       # print the class name of z
[1] "logical"
```

+ Standard logical operations are "&" (and), "|" (or), and "!" (negation).
```r
> u = TRUE; v = FALSE
> u & v          # u AND v
[1] FALSE
> u | v          # u OR v
[1] TRUE
> !u             # negation of u
[1] FALSE
```

#### character
+ used to represent strings in R
```r
> x = as.character(3.14)
> x              # print the character string
[1] "3.14"
> class(x)       # print the class name of x
[1] "character"
```
+ `paste` concatenates character values
```r
> fname = "Joe"; lname ="Smith"
> paste(fname, lname)
[1] "Joe Smith"
```

+ `sprintf` is convenient to create readable strings
```r
> sprintf("%s has %d dollars", "Sam", 100)
[1] "Sam has 100 dollars"
```

+ `substr` extract substring  
```r
> substr("Mary has a little lamb.", start=3, stop=12)
[1] "ry has a l"
```

+ `sub` removes first occurrence with another string
```r
> sub("little", "big", "Mary has a little lamb.")
[1] "Mary has a big lamb."
```

- **

### Vectors
+ a sequence of data elements of the same basic types, members are called _components_  

```r
> c(2, 3, 5)        # a vector containing 3 numeric values
[1] 2 3 5   
> c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)    # a vector of logical values
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE

> length(c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee"))     # length of vector given by length()
[1] 5
```

#### Combining vectors
+ vectors can be combined using the `c()` function


```r
> n = c(2, 3, 5)
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> c(n, s)                                     # 2 vectors combined to 1 vector
[1] "2"  "3"  "5"  "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"   # numeric values are coerced to character
                                              # to maintain the same primitive data type

```

#### Vector arithmetics  


```r
> a = c(1, 3, 5, 7)
> b = c(1, 2, 4, 8)
> 5 * a               # a vector with each of its member multiplied by 5
[1]  5 15 25 35
> a + b               # sum is a vector whose members are the sum of corresponding elemtns from a and b
[1]  2  5  9 15
> a - b
[1]  0  1  1 -1
> a * b
[1]  1  6 20 56
```
+ recycling rules: when two vectors are of unequal length. The shorter vector will be recycled to match the longer vector


```r
> u = c(10, 20, 30)
> v = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
> u + v
[1] 11 22 33 14 25 36 17 28 39
```

#### Vector index
+ Retrival of value from vector by declaring an index inside a single _squre bracket_ `[]`

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")     
> s[3]                                     # starts with 1, not 0
[1] "cc"
```

+ If the index is negative, it would strip the member whose position has the same absolute value as the negative index.    

```r
> s[-3]
[1] "aa" "bb" "dd" "ee"
```

+ If an index is out-of-range, a missing value will be reported via the symbol NA.
```r
> s[10]
[1] NA
```

#### Numeric index vector
+ A new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a __numeric index vector__, which consists of member positions of the original vector to be retrieved.    

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> s[c(2, 3)]
[1] "bb" "cc"

> s[c(2, 3, 3)]           # duplicate index
[1] "bb" "cc" "cc"

> s[c(2, 1, 3)]           # out of order indexes
[1] "bb" "aa" "cc"

> s[2:4]                  # range index
[1] "bb" "cc" "dd"
```

#### Logical Index vector    
+ A new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a logical index vector, which has the same length as the original vector. Its members are TRUE if the corresponding members in the original vector are to be included in the slice, and FALSE if otherwise.    

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> L = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)          # retrieve 2nd and 4th member of s
> s[L]
[1] "bb" "dd"

> s[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]           # abbreviated to a single line
[1] "bb" "dd"
```

#### Named Vector member
+ we can assign names to vector members  

```r
> v = c("Mary", "Sue")                # a character string vector with 2 members
> v
[1] "Mary" "Sue"

> names(v) = c("First", "Last")       # name members
> v
 First   Last
"Mary"  "Sue"

> v["First"]                          # retrieve by name
[1] "Mary"

> v[c("Last", "First")]               #  reverse the order with a character string index vector
  Last  First
 "Sue" "Mary"
```


- **  

### Matrix     
+ A matrix is a collection of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. The data elements must be of the same basic type.   

```r
> A = matrix(
+   c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements
+   nrow=2,              # number of rows
+   ncol=3,              # number of columns
+   byrow = TRUE)        # fill matrix by rows

> A                      # print the matrix
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    4    3
[2,]    1    5    7


> A[2, 3]                # access element at 2nd row, 3rd column
[1] 7

> A[2, ]                 # access the 2nd row
[1] 1 5 7

> A[ ,3]                 # access the 3rd column
[1] 3 7

> A[ ,c(1,3)]           # extract more than one column/row => the 1st and 3rd columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    3
[2,]    1    7

> dimnames(A) = list(                # assign names to the rows and columns of the matrix
+   c("row1", "row2"),               # row names
+   c("col1", "col2", "col3"))       # column names

> A                
     col1 col2 col3
row1    2    4    3
row2    1    5    7

> A["row2", "col3"]                  # access elements by name
[1] 7         
```

### Matrix construction
+ When we construct a matrix directly with data elements, the matrix content is filled along the column orientation by default.

```r
> B = matrix(
+   c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7),
+   nrow=3,
+   ncol=2)

> B             # B has 3 rows and 2 columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    1
[2,]    4    5
[3,]    3    7
```

+ We construct the __transpose__ of a matrix by interchanging its columns and rows with the function t .

```r
> t(B)          # transpose of B
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    4    3
[2,]    1    5    7
```

+ The columns of two matrices having the same number of rows can be __combined__ into a larger matrix. For example, suppose we have another matrix C also with 3 rows.

```r
> C = matrix(
+   c(7, 4, 2),
+   nrow=3,
+   ncol=1)

> C             # C has 3 rows
     [,1]
[1,]    7
[2,]    4
[3,]    2

> cbind(B, C)         # combine columns of B and C with cbind (if they have same number of rows)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    1    7
[2,]    4    5    4
[3,]    3    7    2

> D = matrix(
+   c(6, 2),
+   nrow=1,
+   ncol=2)

> D             # D has 2 columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    6    2

> rbind(B, D)       # combine rows of D and D with rbind  (if they have same number of columns)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    1
[2,]    4    5
[3,]    3    7
[4,]    6    2
```

+ __destruct__ a matrix by applying the c function, which combines all column vectors into one

```r
> c(B)
[1] 2 4 3 1 5 7
```

---       



###List   
+ list a genetic vector containing other objects

```r
> n = c(2, 3, 5)
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
> x = list(n, s, b, 3)   # x contains copies of n, s, b
```

+ __list slicing__ retrieve class by _single squire bracket_ [] operator, which is a slice containing a member of the list, which is a copy of the member in the list

```r
> x[2]
[[1]]                     # showing index of retrieved objects from list in order
[1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"

> x[c(2, 4)]              # retrieving multiple members with an index vector (getting object 2 and 4)
[[1]]
[1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"

[[2]]
[1] 3
```

+ __member reference__ reference list member directly by using _double square bracket_ [[]] operator. The retrieved member is a copy of list member(s) and not a slice containing s or its copy

```r
> x[[2]]                      # a complete copy of second member of list x
[1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"

> x[[2]][1] = "ta"            # reassigning value to x[[2]] change the list, but does not affect
                              # components that form the list (such as s)
> x[[2]]
[1] "ta" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"  
> s
[1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"   # s is unaffected
```

#### Named list members    
+ We can assign names to list members, and reference them by names instead of numeric indexes.   

```r
> v = list(bob=c(2, 3, 5), john=c("aa", "bb"))  # v is a list of two members, named "bob" and "john".
> v
$bob
[1] 2 3 5

$john
[1] "aa" "bb"

```

+ __list slicing__

```r
###
> v["bob"]
$bob
[1] 2 3 5

### retrieve a slice with multiple members
> v[c("john", "bob")]           # use c() to obtain member from a list by names
$john
[1] "aa" "bb"

$bob
[1] 2 3 5

### a named list member can be referenced directly with $ operator in lieu of [[]]
> v$bob
[1] 2 3 5
```

+ __search path attachment__ - We can attach a list to the R search path and access its members _without explicitly mentioning_ the list. It should to be detached for cleanup.

```r
> attach(v)
> bob                     # duplicate names for referencing will direct to the latest attachment
[1] 2 3 5
> detach(v)
```

- **



###Data Frame      
A data frame is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length. For example, the following variable df is a data frame containing three vectors n, s, b.

```r
> n = c(2, 3, 5)
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc")
> b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
> df = data.frame(n, s, b)       # df is a data frame
```

A build in data frame called __mtcars__:   
The top line of the table, called the _header_, contains the column names. Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then followed by the actual data. Each data member of a row is called a _cell_.To retrieve data in a cell, we would enter its row and column coordinates, in this order, in the single square bracket "[]" operator.

```r
> mtcars
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.88 ...
Datsun 710    22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.32 ...
               ............

> mtcars[1, 2]        # obtain cell from row 1 column 2
[1] 6

> mtcars["Mazda RX4", "cyl"]      # use row names instead
[1] 6

> nrow(mtcars)        # nrow() gives the number of data rows
[1] 32

> ncol(mtcars)        # ncol() gives the number of columns
[1] 11

> head(mtcars)        # use head() to preview data
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
               ............
```

> By referencing, we are directly accessing the value and therefore column names will not accompany the return data. Slice, on the other hand, returns a subset of a data frame and therefore retains properties like rownames


#### data frame column vector     
We reference a data frame column with the double square bracket "[[]]" operator.
```r
> mtcars[[9]]    # reference column with double square bracket [[]]
 [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
> mtcars[["am"]]                 # or reference by name
 [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...   
> mtcars$am                      # or retrieve with $ operator
 [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...  
> mtcars[,"am"]                  # use single bracket [], a wildcard match for row position
 [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
```

#### data frame column slice  
We retrieve a data frame column slice with the single square bracket "[]" operator.
```r
> mtcars[1]             # equivalent to    > mtcars["mpg"]
                   mpg
Mazda RX4         21.0
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0
Datsun 710        22.8
                   ............
> mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")]          # retrieving data with 2 columns > pack names in index vector as argument
                  mpg  hp
Mazda RX4         21.0 110
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0 110
Datsun 710        22.8  93
                  ............
```

#### data frame row slice     
We retrieve rows from a data frame with the single square bracket operator, just like what we did with columns. However, in additional to an index vector of row positions, we append an extra comma character. This is important, as the extra comma signals a wildcard match for the second coordinate for column positions.

```r
> mtcars[24,]
            mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt  ...
Camaro Z28 13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.84  ...

> mtcars[c(3, 24),]                         # to retrieve more than one rows
            mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt  ...
Datsun 710 22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.32  ...
Camaro Z28 13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.84  ...

> mtcars[c("Datsun 710", "Camaro Z28"),]    # retrieve by names
            mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt  ...
Datsun 710 22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.32  ...
Camaro Z28 13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.84  ...  

```

+ __Logical indexing__    
Lastly, we can retrieve rows with a logical index vector. In the following vector L, the member value is TRUE if the car has automatic transmission, and FALSE if otherwise. Using L, we can query the data frame and filter for slicing

```r
> L = mtcars$am == 0
> L
 [1]   FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE ...

 > mtcars[L,]                   # list of vehicles with automatic transmission.
                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  ...
Hornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215  ...
Hornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440  ...
                 ............

 > mtcars[L,]$mpg               # and gas mileage data for automatic transmission
  [1] 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 ...
```               

- **    

### Data import    
#### Excel files          
Use __read.xls__ from _gdata_ package, which reads from an Excel datasheet and returns a data frame. This method requires _PERL_ runtime to be present in the system

```r
> library(gdata)                   # load gdata package
> help(read.xls)                   # documentation
> mydata = read.xls("mydata.xls")  # read from first sheet
```    

####SPSS files        
For the data files in SPSS format, it can be opened with the function read.spss also from the foreign package. There is a "to.data.frame" option for choosing whether a data frame is to be returned. By default, it returns a list of components instead.

```r
> library(foreign)                 # load the foreign package
> help(read.spss)                  # documentation
> mydata = read.spss("myfile", to.data.frame=TRUE)
```

#### Table file   
A data table can resides in a _text_ file. The cells inside the table are separated by _blank characters_. Here is an example of a table with 4 rows and 3 columns.

```r
> mydata = read.table("mydata.txt")  # read text file
> mydata                             # print data frame
   V1 V2 V3
1 100 a1 b1
2 200 a2 b2
3 300 a3 b3
4 400 a4 b4
```

#### CSV files    
The sample data can also be in comma separated values (CSV) format. Each cell inside such data file is separated by a special character, which usually is a comma, although other characters can be used as well.The first row of the data file should contain the column names instead of the actual data. Here is a sample of the expected format.     

```r
> mydata = read.csv("mydata.csv")  # read csv file
> mydata
  Col1 Col2 Col3
1  100   a1   b1
2  200   a2   b2
3  300   a3   b3
```
In various European locales, as the comma character serves as the decimal point, the function read.csv2 should be used instead.

#### Working directory   

```r
> getwd()               # get current working directory
You can select a different working directory with the function setwd(), and thus avoid entering the full path of the data files.

> setwd("<new path>")   # set working directory
Note that the forward slash should be used as the path separator even on Windows platform.

> setwd("C:/MyDoc")
```
