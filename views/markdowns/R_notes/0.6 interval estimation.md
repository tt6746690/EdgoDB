Interval Estimation
==================

### Point Estimate of Population Mean

For any particular random sample, we can always compute its sample mean. Although most often it is not the actual population mean, it does serve as a good point estimate. For example, in the data set survey, the survey is performed on a sample of the student population. We can compute the sample mean and use it as an estimate of the corresponding population parameter.

+ problem: Find a point estimate of mean university student height with the sample data from survey.

```r
> library(MASS)                  # load the MASS package
> height.survey = survey$Height

> mean(height.survey, na.rm=TRUE)  # skip missing values
[1] 172.38
```

### Interval Estimate of Population Mean with Known Variance

After we found a point estimate of the population mean, we would need a way to quantify its accuracy. Here, _we discuss the case where the population variance σ2 is assumed known._ Let us denote the 100(1 −α∕2) percentile of the standard normal distribution as zα∕2. For random sample of sufficiently large size, the end points of the interval estimate at (1 − α) confidence level is given as follows: `x = Zα∕2 (σ/root(n))`
